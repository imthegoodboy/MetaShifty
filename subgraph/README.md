# MetaShift Subgraph (placeholder)

Plan:
- Index `CampaignCreated`, `CampaignFunded`, and `ViewPaid` from `MetaShiftAdManager`.
- Expose entities: Campaign, View, FundingEvent.
- Use The Graph Hosted Service or Subgraph Studio.

To bootstrap later:
- graph init --contract-name MetaShiftAdManager --from-contract <address> --network amoy
