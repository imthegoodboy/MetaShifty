THIS IS MY WEB DESVTION WHT DOES IT DO AND HOW 

🌌 1. MetaShift — Decentralized “Ad-to-Earn” Economy for Web3 Users
🔹 Concept:

A Web3 advertising network where users get paid crypto (via SideShift swaps) for viewing or hosting ads on their dApps, websites, or metaverse spaces.
Like Brave Browser’s BAT, but fully decentralized, Polygon-powered, and AI-verified.

 

Projects can rent digital ad slots (like on your NFT dashboard, game, or dApp).

Users who host or view the ads earn crypto rewards.

Rewards are instantly swapped to their preferred token using SideShift (e.g., auto-swap MATIC → USDT).

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Polygon (ad slot ownership NFTs + ad payment contracts)

SideShift API (for instant payout swaps)

The Graph (for ad analytics & on-chain data querying)

AI model for ad verification and fraud detection



 
🧍‍♂️ There are 3 main user types:

Advertisers / Projects

Hosts (Website or dApp Owners)

Viewers / General Users

Let’s see how each one experiences MetaShift 👇

🧠 1. Advertiser POV (Project Owner / Brand)
What They Want:

They want to promote their token, NFT, dApp, or event — but Web3 advertising today is fragmented and centralized (Twitter ads, CEX promotions, etc.).

What They Do:

They visit MetaShift dApp and connect their Polygon wallet.

They choose an ad slot — e.g., a spot on someone’s NFT dashboard, game UI, or blog.

They upload their ad creative (image/video + link) and set a budget in MATIC or USDC.

They deposit funds into a smart contract that holds the payment.

What Happens Behind the Scenes:

The ad is verified by AI (no scams or NSFW content).

The contract locks the ad for the chosen duration and pays hosts automatically based on impressions / clicks recorded on-chain.

Advertisers can see analytics in real-time via The Graph API.

✅ Value for Advertisers:

Transparent pricing, no intermediaries like Google Ads.

Payments and results verified on-chain.

Ads shown only to real humans (AI-bot detection).

🧱 2. Host POV (Developer / Website or dApp Owner)
What They Want:

They want to earn passive income by renting ad space on their dApp, website, or NFT dashboard.

What They Do:

They connect wallet on MetaShift.

They mint an NFT ad-slot that represents a specific space (e.g., “Header Banner on my site”).

They embed a short JS/React snippet into their frontend — this fetches ad content dynamically from the blockchain.

What Happens Behind the Scenes:

Every time a user visits their site or sees an ad, a view event is logged (using The Graph + oracles).

They get paid automatically in MATIC or USDC, or optionally auto-swapped to their preferred crypto using SideShift.

✅ Value for Hosts:

True passive income — no need for ad networks.

Full control of content (they can whitelist or blacklist ad types).

Payments go directly to wallet, instantly, without middlemen.

👀 3. Viewer POV (Normal User / Consumer)
What They Want:

They’re tired of being bombarded with ads that earn them nothing.

What They Do:

They sign in with wallet and browse apps or sites integrated with MetaShift.

When they view or interact with ads (e.g., click, hover, or engage), they earn micro-rewards.

Their rewards can auto-convert to their favorite token (like swapping MATIC → USDT) via SideShift API.

What Happens Behind the Scenes:

AI verifies that the user is real (no bot).

Smart contract mints a “view record” and distributes a small portion of the ad budget to them.

✅ Value for Viewers:

They earn from their attention — “watch-to-earn” model.

Rewards are transparent and instant.

Privacy preserved (no cookies or tracking like Web2 ads).

⚙️ How It All Connects (Simplified Flow)

Advertiser posts an ad and deposits MATIC → Smart Contract

Host’s NFT slot displays the ad on their dApp

Viewer sees it → smart contract records event
